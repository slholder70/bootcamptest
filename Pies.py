# Run through a loop which allows the user to choose which pies to take home with them
for x in range(favorite):

Immediately after, follow the order with Great! We'll have that <PIE NAME> right out for you. and then ask if they would like to make another order. If so, repeat the process.



# A While Loop will continue to loop through the code until all choices are selected
x = "Yes"
while x == "Yes":
    print("Whee! Merry-Go-Rounds are great!")
    x = input("Would you like to go on the Merry-Go-Round again? ")
